     In order to learn programming, 5 types of thinking are needed: <p>
       1. Procedural Thinking <br>
       2. Abstract Thinking <br>
       3. Systematic Thinking <br>
       4. Technological Empathy <br>
       5. Systems Thinking <br>

    <h2> <strong> HTML stands for HyperText and Markup Language </strong> </h2>
      <p> In general it consists of <em>Text </em> content, <em>Markup</em>, <em> References </em> to other documents <br> and <em> Links </em> to other pages <br>
      <br>
      In order to manipulate the content we create, we use tags.
      <br>
      Tags are our way of telling the "stupid" computer, what we want it to do. </p>
      <span> Some tags use attributes, like href or src to classify <br> the procedure behind that content more precisely. </span>
      <p> <div> Attributes can be used: <br>
      - To reference other documents (like with the image above),<br>
      - To <a href="https://unpigeon.me/" alt="This didn't work"> Link </a> to other Websites, <br>
      - To assign CSS code to certain content </div></p>
      Tags (or Elements) can be distinguished into Inline Elements & Block (or Container) Elements <br>
      This will become more important as the degree advances :) <br>

      <!-- It is important to make your code readable to other programmers for review & especially in a working environment -->
      <!-- One method is to include notes within the code, like this one
      <!- Another method is to follow code structure like in this html document
